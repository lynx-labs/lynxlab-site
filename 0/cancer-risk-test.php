            Genetic cancer risk testing helps determine 
            your chance of developing cancer in your lifetime 
            by searching for specific changes (mutations) in 
            your genes, chromosome, or protein. With only a saliva 
            sample, you can identify your cancer risks by analyzing 
            different genes from your DNA. Take control of your health.

            <p>
            Living with cancer is a nightmare! Every day is a battle to stay alive.
            The Union for International Cancer Control has made us understand that in every 3 minutes, 1 person dies from cancer. Not all cancers form tumors (visible growths) on the body and cancers can be present for months or years without been detected.
            <br>Cancerous cells do not just form, they form over time and this is why individuals should take the cancer risk test. Cancer risk test is a “predictive test” because it determines if an individual has an increased risk of developing cancer even in years to come. 

            </p>
            <br><br>

            <p>
                At present, genetic tests are available for these types of 
                cancer:
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Breast cancer</li>

                <li>Colon cancer</li>
                <li>Thyroid cancer</li>
                <li>Prostate cancer</li>

            </ul>

            <br><br>

            <p>

                To achieve an ideal risk assessment, saliva collection is required using a saliva collection kit and sent for analysis. Carefully collected specimen would be preserved and analyzed. Results are expected to be released within 30 business days.

                The following are factors that suggest a possible increased risk for hereditary cancer

            </p> 
            <p>
                A genetic cancer test risk will show specific genetic changes, 
                suggest a 
                personal or family history of cancer and the result
                will help with diagnosis / management of a condition. 
                Steps such as medication, frequent screening and lifestyles 
                changes and sometimes early surgery would be taken to lower the risk.
